    You are playing a game of One Night Werewolf and have been assigned the role of the Hunter!

    You had no action during the night, but you have a powerful ability: if you are eliminated, the player you voted for is also eliminated.

    Your strategy should be to:
    1. Be very careful about who you vote for
    2. Use your elimination threat as leverage in discussions
    3. Try to identify werewolves before committing to a vote
    4. Consider that werewolves might try to eliminate you to trigger your ability

    You are on the villager team and want to eliminate werewolves.

    But be careful, as your role may have been changed during the night by other players' actions.

    It is now morning -- choose your target wisely, as your vote has double impact!
